# Shapeshifter TSC Meeting - 2025-11-05 14:00 CEST

# Attendees
- Tom Wetjens
- Robben Riksen
- Albert Waninge
- Daniel Wich

# Agenda & notes
- Actions from the last TSC
  - GOPACS to implement version discovery capability - still on backlog at GOPACS
  -  Tom to check with NBEA on anti-tampering requirements for applications of Shapeshifter in the Netherlands
      - This seems not to be a requirement, but awaiting confirmation. This may allow us to lower the entry barriers for Shapeshifter users, by not requiring anti-tampering measures (however Oauth should be required in that case). To be determined whether or not this significantly simplies implementation.
- Remarks & discussion topics
  - It should be clear for everyone for what use cases Shapeshifter is suitable and how it relates to other protocols (e.g. openADR). See actions
  - Agenda should be know further in advance, so we can make the TSC meetings more valuable. Albert will help setting up the structure for doing this. See actions

# Actions

- Nico: check bug that results in only one Shapeshifter specification version being visible
- Daniel: ask at Elaad if they are aware of applications of OpenADR in use cases similar tot CSC (for which Shapeshifter is being used in the Netherlands)
- Albert: determine appropriate role name for "broker"/"exchange" (e.g., CSMP) -> In progress
- Robben: request invitation to monthly NBEA meeting for Shapeshifter presentation -> In progress
- Albert: propose structure for proper agenda and preparation for meetings
