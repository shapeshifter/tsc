## **Open Source Strategy & Philosophy**

### **Why Shapeshifter is Open Source**
- **Historical preservation**: Ensure work done on UFTP (specification + XSDs + Java implementation) is not lost
- **Independence**: Not owned by GOPACS or DSOs
- **Interoperability**: Enable communication between any parties implementing the standard, not just single party solutions
- **Network effect**: Value increases with broader adoption across different parties
- **Knowledge sharing**: Share ideas and design for community reuse
- **Transparency**: Documentation value through visible implementation details

### **Shapeshifter vs OpenADR Positioning**
- **Original intent**: Shapeshifter designed for market-based approach (flex negotiation with pricing)
- **Current usage**: Now used directively for CSC contracts (similar to OpenADR)
- **OpenADR characteristics**: More directive and dynamic usage patterns
- **Future goal**: Continue pursuing worldwide adoption
- **Enhanced offerings**: Consider providing demo components beyond just specifications and libraries

**Action Item**: Robben/Daniel to describe differences vs OpenADR

## **Future-Proofing the Protocol**

### **Compatibility Management**
- **XSD improvements**: Enhance XSD compatibility
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive test suite for XML messages
- **Documentation & versioning**: 
  - Parallel publication of docs and XSDs for different versions
  - Major version branches with main as development branch
  - Version branch creation during release stabilization
  - Clear deprecation and end-of-support communication
  - Default landing on latest major release

### **Version Adoption Strategy**
- **DSO-first approach**: DSOs adopt new versions first, AGRs follow within grace period
- **Burden distribution**: Limits version management complexity to small number of DSOs vs many AGRs
- **Discovery enhancement**: GOPACS address book should indicate supported versions

**Action Item**: GOPACS to implement version discovery capability

### **Security Considerations**

#### **Key Rotation**
- Communicate previous and current keys via discovery with validity timestamps

#### **Signing vs OAuth2 Analysis**
- **Current dual purpose**: Authentication and anti-tampering
- **Complexity question**: Whether to support both with and without signing
- **Spec responsibility**: Debate over anti-tampering as spec requirement vs implementor choice
- **Alternative approach**: Readable XML payload in requests without decryption + optional signature attribute

**Action Item**: Tom to check with NBEA on anti-tampering requirements

## **Technical Evolution**

### **JSON Alternative to XML**
- **Implementation concerns**: XML intimidates implementors
- **Experience gap**: Developers more familiar with JSON than XML
- **Technical issues**: XML parsing more complex, less performant, security vulnerabilities
- **Current decision**: Insufficient value seen for JSON migration at this time

### **Broker Topology Support**
- **Formalization need**: Define broker role in specification (currently informal practice)
- **Behavior specification**: Document broker message delivery behavior
- **Enhanced capabilities**: Define broker validation and message rejection processes

**Action Item**: Albert to determine appropriate role name for "broker"/"exchange" (e.g., CSMP)
- Note: Shapeshifter extends beyond congestion management
- CSMP may include capabilities beyond brokering (e.g., contract synchronization)

## **Stakeholder Engagement**

### **Industry Outreach**
- **Target audience**: TSOs, DSOs, and AGRs
- **Engagement strategy**: Present Shapeshifter philosophy, current usage, and future positioning

**Action Item**: Robben to request invitation to monthly NBEA meeting for Shapeshifter presentation

## **Items Not Discussed**

### **Project Maturity**
- Progression from Silver to LFE Gold status

### **GitHub Organization Management**
- Maintainer security (phishing protection)

### **Library Maintenance**
- Long-term commitment to library support

### **Message Expansion**
- Potential usage of additional message types (Metering, Settlement)
